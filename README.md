Some of my notes on Torah  (Jewish Theology).
As of this documents last update, this consists only of an explanation of a section of Shaar HaYichud, the Gate of Unity of the Mittler Rebbe, Rabbi Dov Ber Shneursen.
My notes are mostly based on the audio classes of Rabbi Benyoman Walters, which are available for sale from Kehot under the title Seder Hishtalshelus.
