> None of the festivals will be important except for Purim.

When Moshiach comes, all of the other festivals will be like "a candle in sun
light".

During the Purim story, for almost an entire year, every Jew knew that if they
stayed with G-d they would die. Still, they couldn't even think to leave. G-d
answered by giving us something very special and holy. This is what makes the
happiness of Purim greater than any of the other holidays, even those which the
Torah commands us "rejoice in your festivals"!

Why, then, did the Jews have to wait until they fought and killed 75000 of
their enemies? They deserved Purim during that hard year when they stood with
G-d, and even more when they fought for Him. Why was it given the next day,
when they rested?  
(This is also the difference between the capital and the other cities. In the
other cities the Jews fought on the 13th of Adar and rested on the 14th, and
in the capital they rested on the 15th. The day of Purim for all time was set
in each according to the day of rest.)

First we have to understand the words of the Sages:
> The Jews were told to do three things when they went into Israel
> 1. appoint a king
> 1. destroy the people of Amalek
> 1. build the Temple
>
> and I wouldn't know which is first.<br>
> When the verse says "...", it teaches to apoint a king first.<br>
> Still, I don't know whether to first build the Temple or destroy Amalek.
> When it says "...", it teaches to destroy Amalek, and only afterwards we can
> build the Temple.
>
> _Sanhedrin, 20:a_

The generations also went in this order.

From the time the Jews first reached the Land of Israel there were many great
leaders, but they were not told to destroy Amalek. They were only to conquer
the land and it's seven kings.

Many years later, Shaul, "the first of kings", was appointed. Only then did G-d
command, "I remember what Amalek did to the Jews ... go and strike Amalek and
destroy them".  This was his generation's main mission.

After them came the generation of King Dovid, whose task was to prepare
everything for the Temple. They could not actually build the Temple because,
"You spilled much blood"; Shlomo had to do that. It was still connected to
Dovid's generation, though, as it says in Psalms (30), "_Mizmor_, a song for
the dedication of the House, by Dovid".
