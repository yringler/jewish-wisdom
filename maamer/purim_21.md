> "None of the festivals will be important except for Purim".

When Moshiach comes, all of the other festivals will be like "a candle in sun light".

During the Purim story, for almost an entire year, every Jew knew that if they stayed with G-d they would die. Still, they weren't even able to think to leave. G-d answered by giving us something very special and holy. This is what makes the happiness of Purim greater than any of the other holidays, even those which the Torah commands us "rejoice in your festivals"!

Why, then, did the Jews have to wait until the end of that year, after we fought and killed 75000 of our enemies? Why was the festival of Purim given to us when they rested, and didn't need that strength to stay with G-d?  
(This is also the difference between the capital and the other cities. In the other cities, the Jews fought on the 13th of Adar and rested on the 14th, and in the capital they rested on the 15th. The day of Purim was set in each according to the day of rest.)
