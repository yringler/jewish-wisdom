> "None of the festivals will be important except for Purim".

When Moshiach comes, all of the other festivals will be like "a candle in sun
light".

During the Purim story, for almost an entire year, every Jew knew that if they
stayed with G-d they would die. Still, they weren't even able to think to
leave. G-d answered by giving us something very special and holy. This is what
makes the happiness of Purim greater than any of the other holidays, even those
which the Torah commands us "rejoice in your festivals"!

Why, then, did the Jews have to wait until they fought and killed 75000 of
their enemies? They deserved Purim during that hard year when they stood with
G-d, and even more when they fought for Him. Why was it given the next day,
when they rested?  
(This is also the difference between the capital and the
other cities. In the other cities, the Jews fought on the 13th of Adar and
rested on the 14th, and in the capital they rested on the 15th. The day of
Purim was set in each according to the day of rest.)
